Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Built on a CC3220x-LAUNCHXL Development Kit, This project uses the ti.com gpiointerrupt starter project to make a thermostat with a functioning LED indicator

What did you do particularly well?
I had significant setbacks with trying to utilize a mac M1 to build and run my project in CSS. From it.com "At this time the mac 
silicone chip is not supported by code composer studio"

Where could you improve?
My next machine will definitely not be a mac

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I didn't really use anything new in this course, Stackoverflow, UTM to try and run a VM, parelles,.. none of these solutions solved my problem
but I became more familiar with all of them

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The C programming language is a good tool to be able to write code that is efficient and takes up a minimal about of space for 
embedded devices

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Using keywords, variables, and organizing the code into sections that clearly handled the various 
peripherals will allow others to easily understand and maintain my code.
